# Lights Out

The game consists of a 5 by 5 grid of lights. When the game starts, a random number of these lights is switched on. Pressing any of the lights will toggle it and the adjacent lights. The goal of the puzzle is to switch all the lights off, preferably with as few button presses as possible.[
